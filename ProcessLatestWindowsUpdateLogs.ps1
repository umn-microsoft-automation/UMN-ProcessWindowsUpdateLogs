.Synopsis
   Builds the Windows update logs since the last time the function ran.
.DESCRIPTION
   Builds the Windows update logs from a time specified in a file and then
   updates that file to contain the latest run time. This function is intended
   to be run to automate the collection of the Windows update logs into a SIEM
   solution such as Splunk. This function leverages the Get-WindowsUpdateLog
   cmdlet to convert .etl log files into a text-based log file. This function
   should be executed by an account with administrative rights.
.EXAMPLE
   Invoke-GetLatestWindowsUpdateLogs -etlDirectoryPath "C:\Windows\Logs\WindowsUpdate" `
    -lastRunTimeFilePath "C:\WULogScript\lastruntime.txt" `
    -LogOutputSource "C:\WULogScript\WindowsUpdate.log" `
    -eventLogSource "GetLatestWindowsUpdateLogs"
.etlDirectoryPath
   The path to the directory containing the Windows update .etl log files.
   The default location is: C:\Windows\Logs\WindowsUpdate
.lastRunTimeFilePath
   The location of the file containing a timestamp of the last time the function ran. The file
   should only contain the timestamp (generated using (Get-Date).toString()). The file will be
   overwritten as a part of the function. If the file is not present, the user executing the
   function does not have rights to the file or if the file data is invalid then a date of
   1/1/2018 will be assumed and all Windows update logs written after that date will be processed.
.logOutputPath
   The path for the text-based Windows update log to be written to. This file will be overwritten 
   the next time the function runs.
.eventLogSource
   The name of the Windows Event Log source that will be instantiated in the Windows Application 
   Event Log. This is used to log the function's actions into a log that is assumed to be 
   ingested by a SIEM solution.
